Open Source Game Collection

This is an ultimate collection of installation programs for open source games.

I haven't put any licensing restrictions. It is the responsibility of each user to read of the terms, EULA, or other licensing restrictions prior to using for commercial use. Everything in this collection should be perfectly fine for personal use. That said, this collection is offered "ASIS" with no warranty whatsoever.
